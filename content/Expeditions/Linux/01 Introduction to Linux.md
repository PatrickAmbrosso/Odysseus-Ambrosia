Linux began from humble beginnings and today stands as a truly remarkable piece of software and a testament to the impact of the open source community. This section aims to capture the essence of the journey that Linux took from a small passion project to today's state. #linux-command 

### Origins and Development

Linux's origins can be traced back to *1991* when *Linus Torvalds*, a Finnish computer science student, began developing the Linux kernel as a hobby project. Frustrated by the limitations of proprietary operating systems like MS-DOS, Torvalds set out to create a *Unix-like kernel* that would run on his *Intel 80386-based PC*.

On *August 25, 1991*, Torvalds posted a message to the `comp.os.minix` newsgroup, announcing the project and soliciting feedback from the community. Over the following months, Torvalds continued to refine the kernel, incorporating contributions from other developers and releasing regular updates. On *October 5, 1991*, Torvalds made the first public release of the *Linux kernel, version 0.02*, under the *GNU General Public License (GPL)*, marking the official beginning of the Linux project.

The combination of Torvalds' kernel and the GNU tools developed by Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation led to the term "*GNU/Linux*" to acknowledge both contributions.

### Emergence of a Community

As word spread about the Linux project, a community of developers and enthusiasts began to coalesce around it. In 1992, the first Linux distribution, known as *Softlanding Linux System (SLS)* , was released, providing a packaged version of the Linux kernel along with a collection of utilities and applications. The release of SLS laid the groundwork for future Linux distributions and helped popularize Linux among early adopters. Throughout the 1990s, the Linux community grew rapidly, fueled by the advent of internet access and online forums, such as *Usenet* and *mailing lists*, where developers could collaborate and share ideas. The *open-source* nature of Linux attracted contributors from around the world, who submitted patches, bug fixes, and new features to improve the kernel and expand its capabilities.

### Adoption and Expansion

By the mid-1990s, Linux had gained a foothold in the server and academic computing markets, where its stability, performance, and cost-effectiveness made it an attractive alternative to the proprietary Unix side of things. In 1993, the release of *Slackware*, the *first commercially-supported Linux distribution*, marked a significant milestone in Linux's commercialization and professionalization. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Linux continued to gain momentum, with major corporations like *IBM*, *Red Hat*, and *SUSE* investing in Linux development and offering *enterprise-grade* Linux *solutions* and *support* services. The launch of the *GNOME* [^GNOME] and *KDE* [^KDE] desktop environments in the late 1990s further expanded Linux's appeal, making it more accessible to mainstream users and driving adoption on desktop and laptop computers.
