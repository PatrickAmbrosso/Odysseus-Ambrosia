## The Linux CLI

### Fundamentals

The *Command-Line Interface* or *CLI* is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer by typing commands. In Linux, the CLI is commonly accessed through a terminal emulator, providing a direct means to issue commands to the operating system.

| Terminal | Console | Shell |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A terminal is the software interface that allows users to *interact with the CLI*. It provides a *text-based* environment for entering commands and receiving text-based output. | The console typically refers to the *physical* *terminal* or the terminal window in which the CLI is accessed. | The shell is a *command interpreter* that interprets and *executes user commands*. It acts as an *interface between the user and the kernel*, translating *commands into system actions*. |
| Terminal emulators, such as *GNOME Terminal*, *Konsole*, and *xterm*, are applications that serve as *graphical interfaces to the CLI*. | In Linux, it can also refer to a virtual console accessed using key combinations (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+F1) that provides a *text-only interface*. | Popular shells include *Bash* (Bourne Again SHell), *Zsh* (Z Shell), and *Fish*. Users can choose the shell they prefer, and each shell has its own features and scripting capabilities. |

##### `chmod`

The `chmod` command in Linux is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. It allows providing permissions to users to who can read, write, and execute the file. 

```sh
# General syntax
chmod [options] [permissions] file

```

- Permissions are a way to control access to files and directories. 
- There are three primary permissions
	- `READ`
		- *For Files* - Enables reading the content of the file.
		- *For Directories* - Enables listing the contents of the directory.
	- `WRITE`
		- *For Files* - Enables modifying, appending, or truncating the content of the file.
		- *For Directories* - Enables creating, deleting, or renaming files within the directory.
	- `EXECUTE`
		- *For Files* - Enables executing the file if it is a script or executable.
		- *For Directories* - Enables entering (accessing) the directory.
- Permissions can be assigned to three categories of users
	- `OWNER` - The user who owns the file or directory.
	- `GROUP` - Users who are members of the group associated with the file or directory.
	- `OTHERS` - Users who are neither the owner nor in the group.

The `chmod` command can be applied via two types of notations, namely 
- Numeric notation (octal notation)
- Symbolic notation (letter notation)

**Numeric Notation or Octal Notation**
- In numeric notation, permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number.
- Each digit corresponds to the permission set for a specific user category in the order `OWNER`, `GROUP`, and `OTHERS`.
- The level of permission is denoted by a numerical system with `READ`, `WRITE` and `EXECUTE` privileges assigned as below 
	- `(4) READ (r)` 
	- `(2) WRITE (w)` 
	- `(1) EXECUTE (x)`
- The permission levels can be stringed together by adding the numerical values as follows
	- `(0) NO PERMISSION`
	- `(1) EXECUTE ONLY`
	- `(2) WRITE ONLY`
	- `(3) WRITE AND EXECUTE`
	- `(4) EXECUTE ONLY`
	- `(5) READ AND EXECUTE`
	- `(6) READ AND WRITE`
	- `(7) READ, WRITE & EXECUTE`

```sh
# Basic usage for chmod with numeric notation
# Grants READ, WRITE and EXECUTE Permissions to OWNER, GROUP and OTHERS
chmod 777 program.sh 

# No permissions for OWNER, GROUP, and OTHERS
chmod 000 program.sh

# EXECUTE permission to OWNER ONLY
chmod 100 program.sh

# WRITE permission to OWNER
chmod 200 program.sh

# WRITE & EXECUTE permission to OWNER
chmod 300 program.sh

# READ permission to OWNER ONLY
chmod 400 program.sh

# READ & EXECUTE permission to OWNER
chmod 500 program.sh

# READ & WRITE permission to OWNER
chmod 600 program.sh

# READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE permission to OWNER
chmod 700 program.sh

# Similarly, if the numeric value is assigned
# in the middle number (ex: 010), then the GROUP
# permissions are set and then the final digit 
# (ex: 001) corresponds to the OTHERS

```




```sh
# Common Options
# -c, --changes: Verbosely describe the action for each file processed.
# -f, --silent, --quiet: Suppress most error messages.
# -v, --verbose: Output a diagnostic for every file processed.
# --reference: Use the same permissions as the reference_file.
# --version: Display the version information and exit.

# verbosely describes the action for each file
chmod -c u+x file.txt
chmod -c 100 file.txt
```
